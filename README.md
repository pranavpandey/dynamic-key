## Installation

It can be installed by adding the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // For AndroidX enabled projects.
    implementation 'com.pranavpandey.android:dynamic-key:1.2.0'
}
```

---

## Usage

It provides an `activity` and a `receiver` to implement a dynamic key that can unlock features
in other (client) apps. It has utility methods to validate a key at runtime within the supported 
apps, so they must be signed with the same `signatures` to validate an installed key on the device.

> For a complete reference, please read the [documentation][documentation].

### Broadcast

Broadcast the key event on successful validation to notify key apps so that they can do
the required work. In most cases, it should hide the icon from the app launcher.

```java
// Broadcast the activate intent from the client app.
DynamicKeyUtils.broadcast(context, KEY_PACKAGE, Key.Intent.ACTION_ACTIVATE);
```

### Sponsor

Please become a [sponsor][sponsor] to get a detailed guide and priority support.

### Dependency

It depends on the [dynamic-utils][dynamic-utils] and [dynamic-preferences][dynamic-preferences]
to perform various internal operations. So, their functions can also be used to perform other
useful operations.
